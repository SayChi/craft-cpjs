Control Panel JS plugin for Craft CMS
======================================

Easily insert additional JavaScript into the Craft Control Panel.

After you've installed the plugin, go to:

- **Settings > Plugins > Control Panel JS**

Your custom JavaScript can be saved in either (or both) of two places:

**1) An external file in your public directory...**

**2) The "Additional JavaScript" field on the settings page...**

You can now customize the JavaScript in any way you see fit!
